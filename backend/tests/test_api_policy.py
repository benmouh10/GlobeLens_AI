"""
Enforce the guest/account access matrix across every registered route.

This is the guardrail behind "GUEST can look but cannot act": the test walks the
real application and fails if a route is reachable anonymously while not being on
the explicit guest allowlist. A new endpoint is therefore deny-by-default until
someone classifies it, instead of silently exposing itself.
